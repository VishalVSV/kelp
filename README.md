## TODO:
1. Syntax highlighting - Done - Revamp pending
2. Themes and config files - Done - Revamp pending
3. Plugins?
4. Language server support
5. Panes
6. Prompts for opening files, switching tabs and more (Escape shouldn't close the editor, it should bring up a menu to switch between files or open a new one)

I named this after the first thing that came to my mind, don't judge.
