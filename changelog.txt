Changelog:
1. Improved the file selector to work properly with tabbing through files.
    -> Properly respects typed text as a prefix to search among files
2. Improved the close file prompt and added keyboard selection (How tf did I not add this before)
    -> Added > indicators and underlining.
3. Major document bar changes to prepare for tiling?
